First post ever yeah!!!!! Finally i get start with something!

This blog won't be only a code blog (i am not that good :D).

6 months ago i started a new job at
[Frigel IES](http://www.iesfrigel.com) a branch of
the main company where i am working now
[Frigel Firenze](http://www.frigel.com) as
the name says it is in Florence (Italy).

I have been working for [Frigel IES](http://www.iesfrigel.com)
remotely from [Frigel Firenze](http://www.frigel.com).
In this 6 months i have done a lot (i think) of different tasks:

  -  Repairing computer as it one of duties of an IT
  -  Creating the company website (the Frigel IES one)
  -  Creating a platform in [Genropy](http://www.genropy.org)
  -  Deploying the platform
  -  etc

Yeah Genropy.. probably for 99% of you this framework is unknown (definitely normal).

Before this job i had a nice
[Python](https://www.python.org)/[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) background thanks to my last job at
[Viralize](https://viralize.com) (a great team!).
So the i would like to talk about the transition from a super
documented framework with a huge community like Django to
Genropy not that documented (it could also be my fault :/)
and with a tiny community but super nice and willing to help you.
Genropy is a nice framework when you start understanding how it
works.

I think as first posts it could be good enough (i hope so).
I will try to write the next so as possible!

For now bye!!!

See you in the space cowboy! (cit)
